On app/screens/NewProject.tsx, remove the Suggestions section that appears under “Project Description”. Keep a single Suggestions card below the photo (before the CTA buttons). Ensure the “Refresh” action still calls fetchSuggestions() and the chips still open PromptApplyModal for Replace/Append/Cancel.

Files to edit

app/screens/NewProject.tsx (only)

What to change

Delete the top Suggestions block

Find the JSX section immediately under the description input that renders a title like:

Suggestions, Design Suggestions (beta), or similar, and a Refresh link/button.

It will be above Budget/Skill or above “Add your room photo”.

Remove that entire wrapper <View> (title, bullets/chips, and refresh) so there is no Suggestions content above the photo.

Do not remove Budget, Skill, or the “Add your room photo” divider.

Keep the bottom Suggestions card (below the photo)

Ensure the remaining Suggestions card lives after the photo block (and its “Change photo” link) and before the CTA buttons (“Generate AI Preview”, “Build Plan Without Preview”).

The remaining card should use:

sugs (array of suggestion strings),

sugsBusy (spinner state),

fetchSuggestions() for refresh,

onChipPress → opens PromptApplyModal with the tapped suggestion.

Visibility logic

Show the card only when user has given enough context:

const showSuggestions = !!photoUri || (description?.trim().length ?? 0) >= 10;


Wrap the card in {showSuggestions && ( ... )}.

Wire Refresh + testIDs

The Refresh control must call fetchSuggestions() and respect sugsBusy.

Keep/ensure test IDs on the remaining card:

Card container: testID="np-suggestions-card"

Refresh control: testID="np-suggestions-refresh"

PromptApplyModal still works

Keep the existing PromptApplyModal import, state, and handlers:

applyOpen, setApplyOpen, pendingTip, setPendingTip

normalizeAppend()

Replace/Append logic that updates the description field.

Chips tap → open modal (no change to this flow).

Clean up styles/spacing

Remove any now-unused styles/imports from the deleted top block.

Ensure spacing around the remaining Suggestions card looks consistent with your theme (same vertical margins as other sections).

Acceptance criteria

Only one Suggestions section is rendered on the screen, positioned below the photo and above the CTA buttons.

Tapping Refresh triggers exactly one POST /api/projects/:id/suggestions (or your existing suggestions endpoint) and shows a loading state, then renders the suggestions.

Tapping a suggestion chip opens PromptApplyModal; Replace/Append updates the description correctly; Cancel closes without changes.

No console errors, no duplicate imports, no unused styles.

Don’t change

Any backend URLs, env usage, or unrelated components.

Budget/Skill controls, photo picker, or CTA button handlers.
