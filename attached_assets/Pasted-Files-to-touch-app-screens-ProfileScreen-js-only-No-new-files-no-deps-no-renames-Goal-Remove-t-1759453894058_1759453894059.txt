Files to touch: app/screens/ProfileScreen.js only. No new files, no deps, no renames.

Goal
Remove the temporary Billing Debug (temp) panel and ensure the visible controls work and are accessible:

Manage → opens Stripe Portal

Sync Plan → refreshes entitlements

Upgrade cards → call openCheckout('pro'|'casual')

Settings rows wired (Account, Billing & Payments, Help & Support, Log Out)

Buttons disable while busy; no overlays block taps

Changes (surgical)

Delete debug code

Remove the entire UI block that renders the “Billing Debug (temp)” section (look for that heading).

Remove related state/functions: dbg, setDbg, logDbg, logErr, pingEntitlements, testCheckout, testPortal, devUpgrade, and any dbg-* testIDs.

Keep these helpers intact: api, openExternal, getEntitlements, openCheckout, openPortal, AppState refresh.

Wire real buttons

Manage button: ensure it is a Pressable calling openPortal, with accessibilityRole="button", hitSlop, disabled={busy}, testID="btn-manage-portal".

Sync Plan text: make it a Pressable calling getEntitlements, with testID="btn-sync-plan" and shows busy ? 'Syncing…' : 'Sync Plan'.

Upgrade cards: keep as-is visually; confirm CTAs call openCheckout('pro') / openCheckout('casual'), disabled={busy}, testID="plan-pro-cta" / "plan-casual-cta".

Settings rows (tap targets)
Wrap each row container with a Pressable (or ensure existing wrapper) and wire:

Account Settings → Alert.alert('Coming soon', 'Account settings will land here.') (testID="row-account")

Billing & Payments → openPortal() (testID="row-billing")

Help & Support → guarded Linking.openURL('mailto:support@diygenieapp.com?subject=DIY%20Genie%20Support') (testID="row-help")

Log Out → if a Supabase client is available in scope, call supabase.auth.signOut().catch(()=>{}); otherwise Alert.alert('Logged out (dev)') (testID="row-logout").
All rows: accessibilityRole="button", hitSlop={10}, disabled={busy}.

Tap reliability

On the plan card container, set pointerEvents="auto" and style={{ zIndex: 1 }}.

If any decorative header/gradient sits above, give that element pointerEvents="none" (do not change layout).

Keep behavior

Do not change env usage or endpoints.

Keep the dev fallback inside openCheckout (calls /api/billing/upgrade on 404/501).

Do not modify other screens.

Acceptance Criteria

The Billing Debug (temp) section is gone.

Manage opens a Stripe Portal URL in a new tab/window (or shows a clear alert if 501).

Sync Plan fetches entitlements and updates the plan text/badge without full-screen spinners.

Start Pro / Start Casual open Stripe Checkout; buttons are disabled while busy.

Settings rows respond as specified (Portal/email/placeholder/logout).

No view intercepts taps; all interactive elements have accessibilityRole="button" and the following testIDs exist:
btn-manage-portal, btn-sync-plan, plan-pro-cta, plan-casual-cta, row-account, row-billing, row-help, row-logout.
