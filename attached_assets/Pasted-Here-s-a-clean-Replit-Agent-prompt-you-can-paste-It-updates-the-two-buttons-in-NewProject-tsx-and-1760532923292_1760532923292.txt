Here’s a clean Replit Agent prompt you can paste. It updates the two buttons in `NewProject.tsx` and the reference in `WhatToTest.tsx`, without touching any logic.

**Replit Agent Prompt (ONE task)**

**Scope:** THEME (Expo RN)
**Repo:** DIYGenieTheme
**Target files:** `app/screens/NewProject.tsx`, `app/screens/WhatToTest.tsx`
**Autonomy:** Medium • App Testing: OFF
**Do NOT** rename/move/delete files or change handlers.

**Goal:** Update button copy only (labels + accessibility) for the two CTAs on the New Project screen, and fix the helper text on WhatToTest.

### Changes

#### 1) `app/screens/NewProject.tsx`

Use the grep anchors below to find the right spots:

* Primary block (near lines ~1411)

  * Anchor comments: `/* Primary: Build with visual mockup */`
  * Current strings:

    * `accessibilityLabel="Build with visual mockup"`
    * Visible `<Text>` label: `Build with visual mockup`
    * Subtitle (the line right below the title): `Visual mockup of your space + complete build plan`
  * **Replace with:**

    * Comment: `/* Primary: Generate AI Plan + Preview */`
    * `accessibilityLabel="Generate AI Plan + Preview"`
    * Title text node: `Generate AI Plan + Preview`
    * Subtitle text node: `Visual mockup of your space + complete AI plan`

* Secondary block (near lines ~1525)

  * Anchor comments: `/* Secondary: Build plan only */`
  * Current strings:

    * `accessibilityLabel="Build plan only"`
    * Title text node: `Build plan only`
  * **Replace with:**

    * Comment: `/* Secondary: Create Plan Only (No Preview) */`
    * `accessibilityLabel="Create Plan Only (No Preview)"`
    * Title text node: `Create Plan Only (No Preview)`
    * (Keep the existing subtitle text as-is)

**Important:** Do **not** change the onPress handlers:

* Primary must still use `handleBuildWithPreview`
* Secondary must still use `onBuildWithoutPreview`

#### 2) `app/screens/WhatToTest.tsx`

* Find the line that renders `"Build with visual mockup"` inside the instructional text.
* Replace that quoted text with `"Generate AI Plan + Preview"` (keep quotes in UI text).

### Sanity check

* Ensure **no other** strings “Build with visual mockup” or “Build plan only” remain in these two files.
* Keep styles and layout unchanged.

### After saving

No other edits. I’ll reload the Expo app on my device.
