call /api/projects/:id/suggestions from NewProject.tsx

Goal: After the user fills the form and picks a photo, create (or reuse) a draft project, then POST to /api/projects/:id/suggestions and render a “Smart Suggestions (beta)” card with refresh + loading states. Keep your current photo picker and build buttons intact.

Give this to Agent 3:

Update app/screens/NewProject.tsx to fetch and show server-backed “Smart Suggestions (beta)”.
Requirements:

Use const BASE = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:5000'; and const USER_ID = 'auto'; (we map auto on backend).

State:

draftId: string | null

photoUri: string | null (already present; keep current picker)

sugs: string[] | null (top 5 bullets)

sugsBusy: boolean

promptText: string (pre-filled from form; user editable)

ensureDraft()

If draftId exists, return it.

Else POST ${BASE}/api/projects with JSON: { user_id: USER_ID, name, budget, skill: skillLevel }.

On 200: save res.item.id into draftId.

On 4xx: show toast with server message and abort.

fetchSuggestions()

Preconditions: description >= 10, budget set, skill set, and photoUri present.

await ensureDraft(); then POST ${BASE}/api/projects/${draftId}/suggestions with { user_id: USER_ID, name, budget, skill_level: skillLevel }.

Expect { ok: true, suggestions: string[], tags?: string[] }.

Store top 5 into sugs.

sugsBusy during fetch; catch → toast error.

Triggering:

Call fetchSuggestions() automatically when photoUri becomes non-null and form is valid; also expose a Refresh button.

UI:

Render a card titled “Smart Suggestions (beta)” when sugs is not null.

Each suggestion as a bullet with a ✓ icon.

Small meta line: style: modern • difficulty: {skillLevel} • budget: {budget} (static “modern” is fine for now).

Add a Refresh icon/button; testID="np-suggestions-refresh".

Container has testID="np-suggestions-card".

Keep the existing Generate Plan and Build Without Preview buttons. For Generate Plan, continue to call your build endpoint; do not upload the local photo.

Test IDs to add/keep:

np-suggestions-card, np-suggestions-refresh, np-generate-plan, btn-upload-photo.

Do not navigate away to NewProjectMedia—use the inline picker already in this file.

No new deps. Keep the code idiomatic and minimal.
