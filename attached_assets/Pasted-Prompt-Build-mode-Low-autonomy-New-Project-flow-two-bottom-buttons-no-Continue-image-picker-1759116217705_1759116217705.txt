Prompt (Build mode, Low autonomy)

New Project flow: two bottom buttons (no Continue) + image picker

Tab order (confirm)

In the TabNavigator set order: Home, New Project, Projects, Profile.

Ensure Home/Projects “Start Your First Project” button simply switches to the New Project tab (not to a nested screen).

NewProjectForm.tsx

Keep fields:

Project Description (multiline TextArea, min 10 chars)

Budget dropdown: $, $$, $$$

Skill Level dropdown: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced

Remove the old Continue CTA.

Add a sticky bottom action bar (white bg, 1px top divider #E5E7EB, respects safe area) containing two large buttons side-by-side:

Shared tile specs: width “49%”, height ~56, radius 16, center icon above label (gap 6), soft shadow (opacity ~0.06, blur 20, y=4). Disabled state = 60% opacity + no shadow.

Scan Room (left): white bg, 1.5px border #FBBF24, icon+label #F59E0B. Label Scan Room.

Upload Photo (right): neutral card style — white bg, 1px border #E5E7EB, icon+label #1F2937. Label Upload Photo.

Enablement rule: both buttons are disabled until:

description length ≥ 10, and

budget selected, and

skill level selected.

When enabled:

Upload Photo → use expo-image-picker to open the library; upon success navigate to ProjectPreview.tsx with { imageUri, description, budget, skill }.

Scan Room → navigate to ScanRoomIntro.tsx (stub for AR; no AR implementation yet).

Implement screens

ScanRoomIntro.tsx

Title: Scan your room (Manrope 22/700)

Short steps list (good lighting, stand back, move slowly).

Primary button Start Scan (amber) → for now Alert.alert("AR scan coming soon") and pop back.

ProjectPreview.tsx (simple stub)

Show selected image in a rounded card.

Show the three fields (description, budget, skill).

Primary button Looks Good (amber) → Alert.alert("Next: AI planning").

Home & Projects buttons

Ensure the single Start Your First Project button on Home (and Projects empty state, if used) switches to the New Project tab.

Polish

Keep fonts/colors consistent with Home.

Make sure the sticky action bar stays visible when keyboard is open (KeyboardAware + safe area insets).

Show preview:

New Project tab with disabled buttons → fill fields → buttons enable.

Upload Photo picks an image → ProjectPreview shows it.

Scan Room opens intro screen.
