Goal: Redesign Project Details to match the “simple block list + single CTA” inspiration. Make Detailed Build Plan a separate, long, document-style guide (not the same cards). Keep all existing data/plumbing; just change layout and navigation.

What to build

ProjectDetails screen (rewrite layout)

Files to edit:

app/screens/ProjectDetails.tsx (main)

app/navigation/ProjectsNavigator.tsx (if route names/params needed)

app/components (add a new component below)

Replace the current grid/cards/sheets with a single vertical list of tappable/expandable blocks in this exact order:

Overview — subtitle: “What you’ll build”

Steps — subtitle: “{N} steps”

Materials — subtitle: “{N} items”

Tools — subtitle: “{N} tools”

Cuts — subtitle: “{N} cuts”

Time & Cost — subtitle: “Estimates”

Each block:

Rounded card, soft purple tint (#F3E8FF/#EEEAFE) with subtle shadow.

Left icon (info, list, cube, hammer, scissors, clock).

Title (semibold, larger), small subtitle under it.

Chevron on right.

On tap: expand inline to show a concise summary for that section (e.g., first 1–2 step titles; first 3 materials; etc.). Keep expansion animated (height/collapse); no bottom sheets.

On second tap: collapse.

Top hero area:

Header row: project title.

Large preview/placeholder area (“No scan image yet” or the preview if present).

ONE CTA button centered under the hero:

Label: “Open Detailed Build Plan”

Sub-label (smaller, muted): “Document-style guide with every step and detail”

On press → navigate to DetailedInstructions screen.

Remove any other buttons/Build-Mode UI from this screen.

Keep current plan loading behavior. When planObj is not ready, show a single lavender info banner (“Plan is building…”) in place of the list.

PlanSummaryList component

File: app/components/PlanSummaryList.tsx

Props: { plan: Plan }

Renders the 6 cards in the order above with expand/collapse.

Summary rules:

Overview: first paragraph (truncate to ~3 lines).

Steps: show count and preview first 2 step titles.

Materials: first 3 with qty/unit.

Tools: first 4 tool names.

Cuts: first 3 items (name + size).

Time & Cost: “~{hours} hrs, ~${cost}”

All counts come from the parsed Plan object (we already have parsePlanMarkdown).

DetailedInstructions screen (ensure truly detailed)

File: app/screens/DetailedInstructions.tsx

Keep this as the full, linear, document-style guide. No cards/grids. Sections appear in this order with clear H2 headers and generous spacing:

Title + brief overview paragraph

Materials (full list)

Tools (full list)

Cut List (full)

Step-by-Step (all steps with body text)

Time & Cost

Keep “Save all sections to Photos” as is. Do not duplicate the summary list here.

Navigation / back behavior

Tapping Open Detailed Build Plan: navigate('DetailedInstructions', { projectId }).

Back from DetailedInstructions must return to ProjectDetails (not Home). Verify stack order in ProjectsNavigator.tsx.

Polish & theming

Typography: larger title on cards; smaller muted subtitle.

Card padding: 16–18px; corner radius: 16–20; shadow: very soft.

Icons: use existing icon set (Ionicons/lucide) matching labels above.

Button style matches current primary CTA (solid purple). Sub-label smaller and muted; do not overpower the main label.

Keep existing logic

Keep plan polling/fetching and Plan parser.

Do not reintroduce the old “building plan page.”

Ensure New Project still clears after successful build (already implemented).

Acceptance criteria

ProjectDetails shows one top CTA + six expandable blocks (no other controls).

Expanding a block shows a short summary without navigating.

DetailedInstructions shows the full stitched narrative (not cards) and can save images.

Back from DetailedInstructions returns to ProjectDetails.

No “Build Mode”, no detail sheets, no duplicate lists on either screen.
