You’re Agent 3 on the DIYGenieTheme app. Implement the Plan UI and harden the new-project flow.

Acceptance:
- ProjectDetailsScreen shows:
  - Header (already OK),
  - Room photo (already OK),
  - A **Summary** card under the “Open Plan” button listing: Description, Budget, Skill, Status (badges), and Created date.
- Tapping **Open Plan** navigates to a new **PlanTabs** screen with **four swipeable tabs**:
  1) Overview (step list with progress dots + short intro)
  2) Materials (array of items, quantity, estimated cost)
  3) Tools (array of tools with optional substitutes)
  4) AI Tips (bulleted tips block)
- Data can be **stubbed** for now (use memoized placeholder content keyed by projectId). No network is required for these tabs yet.
- Navigation:
  - ProjectDetails → PlanTabs(projectId) using our existing navigator.
  - PlanTabs uses a top tab or swipeable pager, consistent with our design system.
- Styling matches the current white-card look (no purple gradient on details).
- New Project page:
  - On submit: call POST /api/projects with {user_id, name, budget, skill}.
  - If it returns 403 or {ok:false}, show a toast: “Couldn’t create your project (permission). Try again or contact support.”
  - If success, proceed to photo upload flow (existing flow). Do **not** start preview/build automatically.
- “Upload allowed • Upgrade for AI preview & plans” hint remains.

Tasks:
1) Create PlanTabs (PlanScreen) with 4 tabs and placeholder content. Make it resilient if projectId is missing (show a friendly empty state).
2) Add Summary card component to ProjectDetailsScreen under the button:
   - title/value rows for Description, Budget, Skill, Status, Created.
   - status uses our badge components (preview_ready, plan_ready, etc).
3) Wire navigation from “Open Plan” button to PlanTabs(projectId).
4) In NewProjectForm, ensure we pass {user_id, name, budget, skill} to /api/projects.
   - On 403 or {ok:false}, show a toast and do *not* navigate.
   - On success, continue to photo picker/upload as before.

5) Quick test path:
   - Create a project (should succeed; if not, the toast appears).
   - Go to Projects → Project Details → Open Plan → see tabs with stubs.
   - Confirm the Summary card renders real fields from the project object.

Deliverables:
- New PlanTabs screen with 4 tabs and stubbed data.
- SummaryCard component rendered on ProjectDetailsScreen.
- New-project error handling toast on 403/ok:false.
- Small README note in replit.md explaining the Plan tabs are stubbed.
