Eliminate raw-text crashes + keep only Before/After

Repo: DIYGenieTheme
Autonomy: Low
App Testing: ON

Goals

Fix all “Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component” errors in app/screens/DetailedInstructions.tsx.

Remove the top hero/summary image on this screen (keep Before and After only).

Ensure every “pill / label / stat” is proper <Text> inside a row.

Tasks

Audit & wrap all raw strings

In DetailedInstructions.tsx, scan the whole file and wrap every visible string inside a <Text>:

Units and labels: "hrs", "steps", "ea", "sheet", currency symbols, dots (·), dashes, spaces ({' '}), emojis/symbols.

Any conditional fragments that may render a bare string.

Any numeric values interpolated directly in a <View>—wrap them in <Text> or ${value} inside <Text>.

Typical offenders: the Quick stats row, Materials rows, Cut List table headers, Steps section titles/subtitles.

Create tiny helpers (in the same file) to avoid repeats

RowText({ children }) → returns <Text style={{ fontSize: 14 }}>{children}</Text>

Pill({ icon, label }) → <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', alignItems:'center' }}><Icon ... /><Text>{label}</Text></View>

Use these in the stats row and section headers so no raw text sneaks in.

Hide the hero/summary image on this screen

Remove/comment the hero render block above “Preview”; only show “Before” and “After”.

Guard strings safely

Where you concatenate (e.g., ${qty} ${unit} · ${name}), ensure the whole expression is inside a single <Text>.

Do not leave separators outside <Text>.

Verify sections still render

Materials, Tools, Cut List, Steps show content or their “No … yet” placeholder.

Testing (App Testing = ON)

Run the app on device → Projects → Open Detailed Build Plan.

Confirm:

No red error overlay.

Only Before/After images at the top.

Stats/labels show correctly and scroll fine.

Add 2 screenshots (top area without hero, one section with text-heavy rows) to the PR.

Deliverables

Updated DetailedInstructions.tsx with:

All strings wrapped in <Text> (no raw text).

Hero removed; Before/After remain.

Helpers (RowText, Pill) used where applicable.

PR note: “Fix raw text crash; remove hero; verified on device.”

Stop conditions

If another file (e.g., shared component) is injecting raw strings into this screen, list it and ask before editing.
