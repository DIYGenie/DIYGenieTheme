Goal: On HomeScreen, remove the search bar, move “How it works” above the CTA, and tighten vertical spacing. Keep the purple CTA and chip deep-links exactly as they are.

Files: app/screens/HomeScreen.*

Changes

Remove the search UI

Delete/hide the search bar container at the top (any <TextInput>/SearchBar wrapper).

Remove related state/handlers if they’re only used by the search.

Reorder sections

New order inside the scroll view:

Welcome heading + subheading

How it works chips row (with chevron separators)

Purple Start a New Project button

Recent Projects list (unchanged)

Keep all existing deep-link handlers on the chips.

Tighten spacing + responsive header

Reduce vertical gaps to feel lighter:

mt between heading → chips: ~12–16

chips → CTA: ~16

CTA → Recent header: ~20–24

Heading size: 28 on normal screens, 26 if screen width < 360.

Subheading color stays subdued (same as current), marginBottom ~6–8.

No visual regressions

Keep the purple CTA style as used elsewhere (filled, white text, full width with rounded corners and soft shadow).

Chips remain pill cards; same width logic you just added.

Acceptance

Search bar is gone.

Order = Welcome → Chips → CTA → Recent Projects.

Chips still navigate to the correct New Project sections.

No new warnings in console.

If helpful (example layout skeleton):

// Inside HomeScreen render (pseudo-diff)
<ScrollView contentContainerStyle={{ padding: 16, paddingBottom: 24 }}>
  <Text style={styles.h1}>Welcome back, {firstName}</Text>
  <Text style={styles.h2}>Ready to start your next DIY project?</Text>

  <HowItWorksChips /> {/* existing chips row with arrows */}

  <PrimaryCTA title="Start a New Project" onPress={() => nav.navigate('NewProject')} />

  <SectionHeader title="Recent Projects" />
  <RecentProjectsList />
</ScrollView>


Styles (guide, reuse your theme vars):

h1: fontSize 28 (26 on narrow), fontWeight 700, color #0F172A, marginTop 4, marginBottom 4.

h2: fontSize 16, color rgba(15,23,42,0.6), marginBottom 12–16.

CTA marginTop ~16.

Recent header marginTop ~20–24.

Please implement and keep all existing imports/types clean.
