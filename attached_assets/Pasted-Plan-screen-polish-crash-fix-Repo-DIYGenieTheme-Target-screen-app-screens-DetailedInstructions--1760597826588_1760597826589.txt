Plan screen polish + crash fix

Repo: DIYGenieTheme
Target screen: app/screens/DetailedInstructions.tsx
Autonomy: Low
App Testing: ON

Goals

Crash fix: resolve “Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component” (origin ~line 168 in the “Quick stats” row).

Images: on the Plan page, show Before and After only; remove/disable the hero/summary image at the top.

Section visibility: ensure Materials / Tools / Cut List / Steps render consistently. If a section is empty, show a small “No items yet” placeholder (do not hide the section). Keep existing Safety/Permits cards.

No changes to Project Details page.

Tasks

Wrap all raw text in Quick Stats row

In DetailedInstructions.tsx, any string inside a <View> must be inside <Text>.

Common culprits: “hrs”, “steps”, separators (·, —, spaces as ' '), or conditional fragments.

Ensure the stats row uses <Text> for every visible character and any number labels.

Remove hero/summary image from the Plan page

In DetailedInstructions.tsx, if a top “hero”/summary image is rendered above “Preview,” disable it (comment or guard it out).

Keep the Preview section with Before and After only.

Relax render guards + placeholders

Materials: render the header always. If materials?.length is 0, show “No materials yet.”

Tools: show Required/Optional headers; if an array is empty, render “None listed.”

Cut List: render table headers; if cutList?.items?.length is 0, show “No cuts listed.”

Steps: render the section even if empty; if no steps, show “No build steps yet.”

Do not change data fetching—only presentation.

Keep Preview on Project Details untouched

Confirm there are no edits to app/screens/ProjectDetails.tsx.

Testing (App Testing = ON)

Navigate: Home → Projects → a project → Open Detailed Build Plan.

Verify:

No red error overlay.

Only Before/After images at top (no hero).

Materials/Tools/Cut List/Steps appear with content or a “No … yet” placeholder.

Take a screenshot of the top of the Plan page and the “Steps” section.

Deliverables

Updated app/screens/DetailedInstructions.tsx with:

Quick stats crash fixed (all text wrapped).

Hero image removed; Before/After remain.

Stable rendering + placeholders for empty sections.

PR description with 2 screenshots (top area, steps area) and a one-liner:
“Fix: wrapped text in stats row; removed hero image; added placeholders for empty sections.”

Stop conditions (ask me before proceeding)

If DetailedInstructions.tsx is not the only consumer of the preview images, or if removing the hero affects another route.

If you see any unexpected dependencies on the hero image elsewhere.
