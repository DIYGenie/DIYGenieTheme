Goal

Upgrade the Home screen with:

A 3-slide hero carousel (“before → after” inspiration).

A slim progress bar: “1 Describe • 2 Scan • 3 Preview • 4 Build”.

An Empty-state section with 3 template cards: Shelf, Accent Wall, Mudroom Bench (these create prefilled projects and route to Project Details).

Do not change pricing/gating or navigation names. Keep copy clean and short.
Do not add new dependencies.

Confirm file paths before editing

Home screen file likely: app/screens/HomeScreen.tsx or app/screens/Home.tsx.

If different, stop and ask me with the exact path before creating a new file.

Implementation details
1) Hero carousel (top of Home)

Add a horizontally paging ScrollView (or FlatList horizontal) with 3 slides, full-width, height ~200, rounded corners (12), marginHorizontal 16, marginTop 8.

Each slide shows:

An image (use existing branded images if present; otherwise temporary placeholders):

https://picsum.photos/seed/diygenie2/1200/800

https://picsum.photos/seed/diygenie3/1200/800

A dark gradient overlay (simple semi-transparent View) with a short caption in white:

Slide 1: “See your space transform”

Slide 2: “Measure with your iPhone”

Slide 3: “Get a build plan in minutes”

Add tiny pagination dots below the carousel (3 small Views that reflect the current index).

2) Progress bar (below hero)

Slim horizontal bar with 4 labeled steps, minimal styling; centered text:

“1 Describe • 2 Scan • 3 Preview • 4 Build”

Small muted gray text (#6B7280), fontSize 12, marginTop 8, marginHorizontal 16.

3) Template cards (empty-state suggestions)

Section header text: “Start with a template” (fontSize 18, weight 700, color #3A2EB0, margin: 16).

Three cards in a 1-column list (stacked) or 2-up grid if trivial:

Shelf

Accent Wall

Mudroom Bench

Card style: white background, rounded 12, padding 12, subtle shadow (shadowOpacity 0.05, elevation 2), marginHorizontal 16, marginBottom 10.

Each card shows:

Title (bold)

1-line blurb (e.g., “Clean, modern storage” / “Add depth and contrast” / “Entryway organization”)

Small “Create” button on the right (Pressable with purple text)

On press for each card:

Call an existing “create project” helper (if you have one). Otherwise create a tiny local function in this screen that POSTs to your existing “new project” flow with prefilled minimal payload:

{
  name: 'Shelf' | 'Accent Wall' | 'Mudroom Bench',
  category: 'template',
  templateKey: 'shelf' | 'accent_wall' | 'mudroom_bench'
}


On success, navigate to Project Details for the created project (use the same navigation route you currently use after “New Project”).

If API not available for template creation, fall back to navigating to “New Project” screen with prefilled params (keep it simple and safe).

4) Keep sign-in & header logic intact

Do not alter authentication banners or profile buttons.

Remove any dev/debug prompts that appear on Home if they’re still present (but don’t affect other screens).

5) Telemetry (optional, if util exists)

Fire a small event when a template card is tapped:

safeLogEvent('template_selected', { template: 'shelf' | 'accent_wall' | 'mudroom_bench' })

If safeLogEvent doesn’t exist, no-op.

Testing (App Testing = ON)

Launch app → Home.

Verify:

Hero carousel scrolls horizontally, dots update.

Progress bar text appears and is readable.

Three template cards appear; tapping “Create” creates a project and routes to Project Details.

No red screens, no console errors.

Deliverables

Updated Home screen with carousel, progress text, and template cards.

Note in output: “Home hero + progress + templates added; template create → Project Details verified.”

Stop conditions

If Home file path differs, pause and ask me with the exact path before creating new files.

If there’s no existing create-project endpoint, state the current creation flow and how you prefilled it.
