Upgrade the Plan page presentation (no backend changes)

Repo: DIYGenieTheme
Target screen: app/screens/DetailedInstructions.tsx
Autonomy: Medium
App Testing: ON

Goal

Elevate the Project Plan screen from a basic list to a polished build guide using the existing GET /api/projects/:id/plan fields. Do not rename files or routes.

Do

Summary header

Keep your purple hero. Add 3 compact “pills”: time (estTimeHours), cost (estCostUsd), and step count (derived from steps.length).

Overview

If empty, render “No overview available.” (already done), else show text.

Safety + Permits callouts

Render as colored cards (you already have this—ensure they’re always above Materials if present).

Materials

Show each item as qty unit · name with right-aligned price.

Compute and show Materials Subtotal at the end (sum of subtotalUsd when present).

Tools

Two sublists: Required, Optional (don’t show “Optional” header if empty).

Cut List

Table-style rows: left = board, middle = dims, right = qty.

If layoutSvgUrl exists, render an inline thumbnail with a “View layout” action (open in browser or modal).

Steps

Numbered sections with title, description, optional diagram.

Add a tiny progress bar at the top (e.g., current/total when user scrolls; for now, static: 0%).

Keep steps read-only (checkboxes come later).

Totals footer

If you can compute materials subtotal, show Estimated Cost = estCostUsd if provided; else show the computed subtotal with a “~” tilde to indicate estimate.

Don’t

Don’t change routes, params, or API calls.

Don’t introduce checkboxes or PDF export yet—next steps.

Testing (App Testing = ON)

Use one project with full plan data, and one with partial data.

Verify: header pills, safety/permit cards, materials subtotal, cut list alignment, steps formatting.

No regressions navigating from Projects → Project Details → Open Detailed Build Plan.

Deliverables

Updated DetailedInstructions.tsx with the above presentation improvements.

Minor style tweaks only; no new dependencies.
