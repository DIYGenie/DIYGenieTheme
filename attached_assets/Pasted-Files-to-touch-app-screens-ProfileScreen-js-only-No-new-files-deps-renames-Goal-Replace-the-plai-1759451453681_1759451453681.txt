Files to touch: app/screens/ProfileScreen.js only. No new files/deps/renames.

Goal
Replace the plain “Upgrade Plan” picker with two attractive plan cards that sell benefits and prices. Keep all existing wiring (openCheckout('casual'|'pro'), openPortal, getEntitlements) unchanged. Subtle highlight on Pro. Brand-consistent (purple→blue vibe, Manrope headers, Inter body), accessible, and mobile-first.

Implement

Locate & replace the inline upgrade block (currently shown when showUpgradePicker is true). Remove the two simple buttons and render two PlanCard blocks inside a container Card. Keep the top “Cancel” button as-is (closes the picker).

Add an inline PlanCard component in this file (below imports, above component or inside file-scope). Props:

title, priceText, subtitle, features (string[]), ctaText, onPress, popular?: boolean, testID.

Visuals:

Use a rounded Card with soft shadow, uniform white surface.

Header row: title (Manrope, semibold), small “Most popular” Badge if popular.

Big price row: priceText (e.g., $14.99/mo) with subtle /mo secondary style.

Bulleted features list with ✓ (use plain Text + emoji check to avoid deps) and consistent spacing (8–10px).

CTA uses ButtonPrimary full-width; onPress calls provided handler; set accessibilityRole="button" and testID.

Subtle Pro accent: thin 2px border with brand-purple (#6F4BFF) and a faint background tint (rgba(111,75,255,0.06)); Casual gets neutral border (#E8E9EE). No new gradient deps.

Min tap size 44px; high contrast; respect existing spacing tokens.

Render both plans inside the picker container, stacked with 12–16px gap (on wide web, allow two-column via flexDirection: row; flexWrap: wrap; but keep mobile single-column):

Pro (highlighted softly):

title: 'Pro'

priceText: '$14.99/mo'

subtitle: 'Best for frequent builders'

features:

25 projects/month

Unlimited previews (Decor8)

AR Scan access (stub)

Save & export plans

Priority improvements access

ctaText: 'Start Pro — $14.99/mo'

popular: true

onPress: () => openCheckout('pro')

testID: 'plan-pro-cta'

Casual:

title: 'Casual'

priceText: '$5.99/mo'

subtitle: 'Great for occasional projects'

features:

5 projects/month

Unlimited previews (Decor8)

AR Scan access (stub)

Save & export plans

ctaText: 'Start Casual — $5.99/mo'

onPress: () => openCheckout('casual')

testID: 'plan-casual-cta'

Small footnote under cards (centered, 12px):

“Cancel anytime via Manage (Stripe Portal).”

Tapping “Manage” still calls openPortal().

Accessibility & QA hooks

Add accessible and accessibilityRole="button" to CTAs.

Expose testIDs: plan-pro-cta, plan-casual-cta, and container testID="upgrade-cards".

Ensure buttons disable on busy.

Acceptance criteria

Opening Upgrade Plan shows two polished cards with prices, features, and a subtle “Most popular” badge on Pro.

Start Pro — $14.99/mo triggers openCheckout('pro'); Start Casual — $5.99/mo triggers openCheckout('casual').

Buttons reflect loading (busy disabled).

Visuals are on-brand, readable, and responsive on web/mobile.

No new dependencies or files; Profile functionality (Manage, Sync Plan, entitlements refresh) unchanged.
