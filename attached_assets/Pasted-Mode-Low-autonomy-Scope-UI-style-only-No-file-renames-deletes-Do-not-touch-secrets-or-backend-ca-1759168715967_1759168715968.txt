Mode: Low autonomy
Scope: UI/style only. No file renames/deletes. Do not touch secrets or backend calls.

Goal:

Fix the Skill dropdown overlay so its menu renders above content (not inside/behind tiles).

Keep the screen on one page (no scroll) for standard iPhone 13/14/15 viewports.

Ensure “Add your room photo” tiles are visually separate and never appear inside the dropdown.

Maintain validation gating (tiles disabled until description ≥10 chars + budget + skill selected).

Files to edit (exact only; create if missing but ask before creating a new screen):

app/screens/NewProject.tsx (or the existing New Project screen file)

app/theme/tokens.ts (spacing/size tokens if present)

app/components/Dropdown.tsx (or the local dropdown wrapper, if we use one)

app/styles/newProject.ts (if styles split out)

Implementation details:

Dropdown rendering & stacking

If using react-native-paper menus: wrap the dropdown’s menu in <Portal> so it renders at the app root.

If using react-native-dropdown-picker: set zIndex={3000} and zIndexInverse={1000} on the Skill dropdown; for the Budget dropdown use zIndex={2000}. Add elevation={6} to the open menu container.

Ensure parent containers of the dropdowns have overflow: 'visible'.

Add a style rule so the photo tiles container has zIndex: 0.

One-page layout (no scroll)

Use a top-level View (not ScrollView) with flex: 1 and internal vertical stack.

Reduce vertical spacing to fit:

Title block marginBottom: 8–12

Field block gaps: 12–14

“Add your room photo” label marginTop: 12

Limit description text area to 3 rows (height: ~96–110). Show the “≥10 chars” helper on a single line.

Ensure tab bar height is respected; content should fit within viewport of iPhone 13–15.

Photo tiles alignment & states

Place tiles in a 2-column grid (each ~48% width) or a single row if that fits better.

“Scan Room” = orange outline style; “Upload Photo” = neutral card.

Disabled state until valid: reduce opacity to 0.4 and set pointerEvents="none".

After valid: restore opacity 1 and enable press handlers.

Validation (visual enforcement only)

Valid when: description length ≥10 AND budget selected AND skill selected.

Show inline helper below description (e.g., “Minimum 10 characters”).

If invalid, keep tiles disabled and show subtle helper text above the tiles: “Complete the fields to add your room photo.”

Typography & colors

Use Manrope for headings/buttons, Inter for body.

Keep brand gradient on page background; field labels in medium weight; helpers in subdued gray.

Icons: camera on “Scan Room”, image on “Upload Photo”.

Acceptance criteria:

Opening the Skill dropdown renders its menu above everything (no tile overlap).

The New Project screen fits on one page on iPhone 13–15 (no scrolling).

The two photo tiles never appear inside the dropdown; they remain visually below with consistent spacing.

Tiles remain disabled until validation passes; after valid, both enable and look active.

No file renames/deletes; no backend or secret changes.
